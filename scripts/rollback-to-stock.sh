# /overlay shares stock's settings volume on mtd28 (bigoverlay). Stock does not
# keep its settings as plain files there. Its preinit (89_mount_sec_cfg) moves
# them into an encrypted container, sec_cfg/data.vol (a spare copy lives in
# usr/sec_cfg/data.vol), and binds the opened container over /data/etc/config.
# Seen from OpenWrt, etc/config is an empty directory even on a fully set up
# stock. Stock builds without the container keep the files in etc/config.
#
# If either is there, stock picks its settings up again by itself, and
# flag_format_overlay must stay unset: stock acts on the flag after it has
# opened the container (90_mount_bind_etc, init_data_dir), empties it and
# copies its ROM defaults in, so it comes up in the setup wizard. 1.2.6 and
# 1.2.7 looked at etc/config only and did exactly that on every rollback.
#
# Only when the volume carries neither (the partition was formatted by
# bigoverlay 1.2 to 1.2.5 and holds only our files) tell stock to repopulate
# /data/etc from its ROM; otherwise it comes up with an empty /etc/config and
# even SSH will not start.
